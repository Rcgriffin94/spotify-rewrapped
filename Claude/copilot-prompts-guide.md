## Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Authentication

### Step 1.1: Initialize Project
```
Create a new Next.js 14 project called "spotify-music-trends" with the following specifications:
- Use TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Use App Router
- Install these additional dependencies: next-auth, @auth/core, lucide-react, react-hot-toast, recharts, @types/node

Include a package.json with all required dependencies and scripts for development.
```

### Step 1.2: Environment Setup
```
Create the following files for environment configuration:
1. .env.local template with Spotify OAuth variables
2. .env.example showing required environment variables
3. Update next.config.js to handle images from Spotify CDN domains

Include comments explaining what each environment variable is for and where to get the values.
```

### Step 1.3: Basic Project Structure
```
Set up the initial folder structure for our Spotify music trends app:
- Create the main directories: app/, components/, lib/, types/, hooks/
- Create subdirectories: components/ui/, components/layout/, components/music/, types/
- Add index.ts barrel exports for each major directory
- Create a basic globals.css with Spotify brand colors (#1DB954 green, #191414 black, #FFFFFF white)

Show the complete folder structure and basic CSS setup.
```

**ðŸ§ª Test Step 1:** Run `npm run dev` and verify the Next.js app starts without errors.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **One step at a time**: Complete each step fully before moving to the next
2. **Test everything**: Use the test steps to verify functionality
3. **Ask follow-ups**: If Copilot's response isn't complete, ask for clarification
4. **Modify as needed**: Adjust prompts based on what Copilot generates
5. **Save progress**: Commit code after each working step

## ðŸ”§ Debugging Prompts

If something doesn't work, use these follow-up prompts:
- "The code you generated has an error: [paste error]. How do I fix this?"
- "This component isn't displaying correctly. Help me debug the styling."
- "The API call is failing. Help me add better error handling."
- "How do I test this functionality to make sure it works?"

Good luck building your Spotify trends website! ðŸŽµ
